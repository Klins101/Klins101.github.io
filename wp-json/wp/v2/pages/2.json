As the Director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/core-robotics.gatech.edu\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/core-robotics.gatech.edu\/\">CORE Robotics Lab<\/a>, I seek to design robots that can learn from interaction with people and their environments, explain to their human partners what was learned from those interactions, and collaborate in diverse human-robot teams in domains from home healthcare to manufacturing, autonomous driving, disaster response, and national security. The topic areas we advance in my lab include explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), human-robot interaction (HRI), deep reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), graph neural networks (GNNs), and natural language processing (NLP).
